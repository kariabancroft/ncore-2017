# "But I'm a Good Person": Engaging Whiteness & Emotional Intelligence

- Highlights of what happens in Inter-group Dialogue (IGD)

**Activity**:
- Reading a statement about a training or learning about whiteness and identifying a feeling that you associate with that statement
  - Egs: "You think this training might not be about you", etc.
  - Use an "emotions" cheat sheet

**Notes**:
- Flaws of IGD:
  - reduces identity groups, audience limitations
  - #s are never in favor of the marginalized groups
  - some folks think its a "one and done" scenario
  - compartmentalizing emotional work and anti-racist work to **one space & time**
  - not conducive to the _intersectional_ approach
  - being _emotional_ is in argument with being _professional_
  - displacement of labor is on POC
- their group is rarely white men, but when they do attend it is primarily that they do not engage at all or that they over-engage
- white women "simply cannot believe that they are oppressed and still can be oppressive"
- they approach from the standpoint of "do white people have anything to teach POC on race & racism? we think not."

- **Pop-Culture & White Feminism**

  - White Feminism 101
    - Anti-intersectionality
    - Gender essentialism
    - White savior complex
    - Gatekeeping
    - Liberation == Achieving the white man's status
  - Examples:
    - Jennifer Lawrence and her disrespect to the Hawaiian historic landmarks
    - Pepsi ad vs Jennifer
    - Amy Poehler approving a rape joke on a show w/ Blue Ivy
  - The consequences of these actions are _not against_ these white feminist celebrities, they are against those who are in the minority groups
  - **White Tantrums**
    - highest consequence is on POC
      - white impunity
      - POC labor/harm
        - cyclical
    - **Framework for analysis** of a white tantrum:
      - White tantrum
      - Perceived white consequence(s)
      - Actual consequence(s)
        - _Includes mental, physical, economic, and social consequences for POC_
      - My role
        - _Consider your identities, socially, professionally, where were you in the vent or the aftermath?_
      - My Emotional response
        - _How did you feel during and in the aftermath? It's okay if your emotional responses appear to be in conflict_
