# Deep Diversity: Overcoming Us vs. Them

**Setting the Stage**:
- Think of someone whose presence brings out your best self
- What are some of the feelings that come along with being with this person
- Then as a follow up, how frequently do you feel this within your/our organization?

**Book**:
- [Deep Diversity: Overcoming Us vs. Them by Shakil Coudhury](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Diversity-Overcoming-vs-Them/dp/1771130253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496695449&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+diversity)


**Notes**:
- He started out his career with social justice and burned out, then transformed his work with neurology and psychology
- Our brain is an anticipation machine; it separates things into boxes and categories
- The difference between our brain (physical organ) and our mind (what the brain does)
  - Using a metaphor of a rider on an elephant. The rider is the _conscious mind_ while the elephant is the _unconscious mind_
  - Moving from the elephant to the rider requires motivation and practice, practice, practice
  - We all need to uncover and unlearn at the unconscious level
- **Compassion** starts with ourselves
- How many of us have been in a room where the _mood_ in the room is determined and transmitted by the one person who is the _most emotionally expressive_?
  - This is important because we react to emotionally to the identities of people even without our awareness
  - Empathy goes down in our perceived "threat groups"
- Our brain registers "out groups" in a _different_ part of the brain
  - Classifying as _objects_ & _things_
  - This is the starting point of _dehumanization_
- **Neurology does not distinguish between progressive and conservatives**
- Compassion for out groups **must be taught**
- **4 Activist Traps**
  1. Poor self-care/high burn out
    - enjoy the small things
    - nurture relationships
  2. Despair -> Critical/Cynical
    - there is a line between critical thinking and cynicism
  3. Theory = "Truth"
    - trap of universal truth that explains **everything**
    - attempting to apply something linear when human psych is not at all linear
  4. Dehumanize allies/opponents
    - "not enoughness"
- **Solution: Emotional Literacy**
  - Deep self-awareness
  - Self-regulation; especially under stress
  - Empathy
  - Relationship-building & conflict skills
- neurologically it is easier for us to generate empathy for individuals over large groups
- focusing on the **brain** rather than **your and your privilege**
- Just keep in mind, "Were really good at raining on everyones parade... including our own"
