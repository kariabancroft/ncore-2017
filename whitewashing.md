**Notes**
- Originated from [minstrelsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show) in the 1830s-40s which gave ethnic whites (who were not perceived yet as white) the chance to further whiten themselves by imitating other races
- #whitewashedout was a movement started by academics & picked up by celebs
- [Dumbfoundead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmvqb9Uzu8k) on YouTube did a cool video in response
